# XploitSim - Broken Access Control Sandbox

**DANGER:** This repository intentionally contains vulnerable endpoints **for educational use only**.

## Safety rules (must read)
- This server refuses to run unless `SANDBOX=1` and `NODE_ENV` != `production`.
- Do not expose this server to public networks.
- Use only on localhost or inside an isolated network (e.g., local VM).

Follow instructions in the project root for seeding the DB and running tests.
